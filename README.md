# Thinkful-Lariat-Rentals-Project

In this project, I analyzed a data set from an imaginary rental car company, Lariat Rent-A-Car. I was able to create an interactive dashboard that helped compare critical factors, such as ROI, of any vehicle in the fleet to the company benchmark. I then created several recommendations to help maximize revenue and profit. There is a dashboard to compliment this, which allows the user to choose the top vehicles and add them to the fleet.
